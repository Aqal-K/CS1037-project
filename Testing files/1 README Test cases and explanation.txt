In this folder, you can see all input txt, encoded huf, and ouput txt files for the provided test cases. Compression ratios can be seen by comparing input/encoded file sizes.
    - Input files labeled:      "input_<name>.txt"
    - Encoded files labeled:    "encoded_<name>.huf"
    - Decoded files labeled:    "decoded_<name>.txt"

Note:   if you want to test these files yourself, the path will be "Testing files/<filename>", 
        assuming the folder "Testing files" is a subfolder inside of where the compiled exe is.
